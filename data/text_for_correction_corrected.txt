For indeed they are;
The Book succeeds in rendering all ethical questions
trivially solvable, by banishing the concept of ethics
altogether, and reducing all such considerations to a
question of “is it in accordance with, and necessary for,
the fulfillment of my will, or is it not?” The Thelemite
is released from the requirement to consider others, and
need concentrate only on his own nature.
Of course, this does not mean he magically aquires the
ability to “stamp down the weak” without any form of
repercussion or sanction, but this always was and always
will be the case; the lion cannot stalk the herd of
wildebeest without risk. He is, however, released from all
obligation to consider the “rightness” of his actions,
and instead need focus only on the harmony of those actions
with his will, which naturally includes a consideration of
their likely consequences also.
